# Homework-Spring2018
CIST 2371 (Java 1), CIST 1201 (SQL)

This is my first repository. Select homework will be placed here.  I'm using it to learn and be comfortable with using git/github. Hilarity will ensue.

Love, Patricia Renee.

Ok, now I'm changing it to follow the tutorial.  I might have mucked it up because i made some changes before and didn't 
know what I was looking at.  Sometimes when I looked at the file it had funny colors. hmmm.  I need coffee.
